## Content

***(In a world once ruled by ancient beings, a prodigious man comes forth and brings a new religion, the religion of Pokémon.
These beings think that this religion will die out as many have before, but it didn't.
The religion grew and grew as people liked the idea of multiple pets to keep.
As religion grew, the power of the beings diminished and they took a gamble.
They set out to destroy the world.
But at that very moment, an egg emerged out of nothingness.
The egg started to hatch while the world was being ravaged by the beings.
When the egg finally hatched, a beautiful, radiant creature with a thousand hands emerged.
Seeing the destruction around itself, the creature is sent out to fight the beings.
After fighting a great war with the beings, the creature sealed the being within its thousand hands, shedding them.
Knowing the beings would escape one day, the creature created 3 guardians.
Dialga, Protector of Time.
Palkia, Protector of Space.
Lastly Giratina, Protector of the other world, a world created as a last resort to save the world.
Then the creature split its power and created all the species of pokemon.
Keeping some knowledge of the now-sealed beings for future generations to use when the time arose to combat the gods.)***

> TL;DR:
Greek gods rule the world, pokémon religion starts existing but the greek gods don’t like that so they try to kill everything but then Arceus hatches and is like "no u" and seals the greek gods away.
Arceus decides to be smart and creates the creation trio to make sure the Greek gods don’t return and then creates the rest of the Pokémon species.
Blah blah blah, hidden knowledge plot point for the player to find to fight the gods eventually.

###### \[Intro, black screen the entire time\]

???: "..."<br/>
???: "You came."<br/>
***(brief pause)***<br/>
???: "Are you sure?"<br/>
???: "You do realize that once you make this decision, you can never turn back, right?"<br/>

***(2 second pause)***<br/>
???: \*sigh\*<br/>
???: "...I’m sorry."<br/>
???: "What kind of god am I..."<br/>
???: "...sending a mortal to achieve something they don’t even understand."<br/>

***(another 2 second pause)***<br/>
???: "Well, what’s done is done."<br/>
???: "You’ve agreed. We can only go forward from here."<br/>
***(brief pause)***<br/>
???: "I may as well give some explanation."<br/>
???: "I was once like you, you know."<br/>
???: "Blissfully ignorant of the past, worried about things that are so insignificant in the grand scheme of things."<br/>
???: "But I too, was chosen by a god to do what seemed like an impossible task."<br/>
???: "Let me tell you my story."<br/>

***(brief pause)***<br/>
???: "A story about the lost origins."<br/>

###### \[fade to white, mini animation thingy showing arceus/the starters occurs\]

**{Player presses enter or whatever}**

> The 1st ??? is a god/goddess that’s disguised.
Probably hera, but you can choose ia.
The 2nd ??? is Arceus.
The player doesn’t know either obviously.

###### \[2nd part of the Intro, Black screen, maybe a fuzzy silhouette of the god(dess)\]

???: "Someone help me! I’m being hunted down!"<br/>
`<\PN>`: "..."<br/>
???: "Is that... another person? Oh, you're a lifesaver."<br/>
???: "Wait, you’re not one of them, are you?"<br/>

- **{Not at all!}** ***(+5 Decisiveness, continue below)***<br/>
- **{No?}** ***(+5 Empathy, continue below)***<br/>
- **{Why would I be?}** "In my experience no one can be trusted. That includes you." ***(+5 Integrity, continue below)***<br/>
- **{Who?}** "You’re not lying, are you?" ***(+5 Ruthlessness, continue below)***<br/>

> Lmao imagine having free choices

???: "Prove it then, tell me your name."<br/>

- **{Player inputs name}** ***(Set Player name to answer)***<br/>

???: "Are you sure?"<br/>

- **{Yes}** ***(continue to below)***<br/>
- **{No}** "How do you not even know your own name? Hurry up and tell me it already!" ***(loop until player answers 'yes')***<br/>

???: "Hmph, interesting..."<br/>
???: "Well `<\PN>`, it’s too dark for me to see you. Could you show me what you look like?"<br/>

###### \[MC options show up\]

- **{Male MC}** ***(Set Player sprites to male mc)***<br/>
- **{Enby MC}** ***(Set Player sprites to enby mc)***<br/>
- **{Female MC}** ***(Set Player sprites to female mc)***<br/>

###### \[MC options disappear\]

???: "Mmh..."<br/>

***(Brief Pause)***

- **{He/Him}** ***(Set Player pronouns to male)***<br/>
- **{They/Them}** ***(Set Player pronouns to enby)***<br/>
- **{She/Her}** ***(Set Player pronouns to female)***<br/>

`<\PN>`: "..."<br/>
???: "What’s with that look?"<br/>
???: "Just because I’m being chased doesn’t mean that I’m not cultured."<br/>
???: "Whatever, I suppose I can trust you now."<br/>
???: "I should explain. I’m being chased by&#151;"<br/>

###### \[Screen shakes violently\]

???: "Shoot. They’re here."<br/>

###### \[Screen shakes again, then starts shaking every so often while the text below runs\]

???: "Before I go, know this. Don't trust what they tell you."<br/>

###### \[Silhouette disappears. The screen shakes even more violently, longer this time. Then, a flash and fade to white screen\]

???: "Leave, and never come back!"<br/>
***(pause)***
???: "...I should've known they'd intercept..."<br/>
???: "`<\PN>`, I'm sorry this is so sudden, but I have entrusted you with a very important task. Theos... is in grave danger."<br/>
???: "You must save our world from impending doom. Win, and become a hero. There are no second chances if you lose."<br/>
???: "I implore you to prepare for your adventure. You will see me shortly."<br/>
***(pause)***
???: "Also, ignore whatever they told you. You will understand who they are soon."<br/>

###### \[Screen fades to black again\]

###### \[Post Intro\]

`<\PN>`: "Ugh, that was a strange dream."<br/>


###### \[From downstairs:\]

Mom: "Hey are you awake `<\PN>`?"<br/>


`<\PN>`: "I’m awake Mom, let me just come downstairs."<br/>

Dad: "Hey kiddo, you’ve finally turned 18, are ya excited? We’ve got a lab in town after but it’s not finished yet. But we finally have a lab in our small town after such a long time. (def not me being lazy) The professor says he’ll walk you and Elina down to `<city name>` to choose your starters. You should go meet him outside."<br/>

###### \[While walking towards the door\]

Mom: "Hey! I got some new shoes for you."<br/>
`<\PN>` obtained the running shoes


`<\PN>`: "Thanks Mom, really appreciate it."<br/>

***(After heading out the door you head down to talk to professor and introduction to Elina, Zeus comes and destroy town, arceus comes and save and you battle the god with arceus, and after that you get your starter from arceus)***

???: "I SENSE THE PRESENCE OF THAT DAMNED HORSE HERE. WHERE DOES HE HIDE. WHAT GOD HIDES AMONGST HIS PEOPLE? THAT COWARD, HE CALLS HIMSELF A GOD?"<br/>

> Humorous tone

###### \[Arceus descends from heaven or whatever, the sky ig\]

Arceus: "Ah, Zeus. Long time no see! How are the kids?"<br/>

Zeus: "ARCEUS! YOU COWARD! YOU DARE PRETEND TO BE A FRIEND AFTER EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TAKEN?"<br/>

Arceus: \*shrugs\* "It was worth a try."<br/>

Zeus: "I WILL NOT SUFFER THIS DISRESPECT. COME AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN."<br/>

Arceus: "Hey now, unlike you, I’m open to every pronoun, not just he/him. Things aren’t the same now. Might want to catch up with the times. I can lend you a copy of the Theos Times if you’d like."<br/>

###### \[Zeus releases a bolt of lightning in anger, which Arceus blocks\]

Arceus: "Calm down buddy, we got mortals here. Last time I checked, gods were supposed to be setting good examples."<br/>

###### \[Zeus thinks for a moment\]

Zeus: "Mortals..."<br/>
Zeus: "Mortals that do not deserve to live for worshipping a false god."<br/>

###### \[Arceus widens its eyes\]

Arceus: "**EVERYONE, GET DOW**&#151;"<br/>

###### \[Explosion of white, white slowly fades away to find hometown destroyed with Arceus protecting the humans gathered around & `<\PN>` with a white sphere force field thingy\]

Arceus: "..."<br/>

###### \[Arceus turns to the left then the right as if looking around\]

Arceus: "Looks like someone has anger issues."<br/>
Arceus: "Zeus, tell me, how does destroying an innocent town help you at all? We both know that as gods you need mortals to believe, to trust in you for your power to be the strongest it can be. This mess you’ve created? I don’t think the mortals are going to like you very much considering you just annihilated their homes."<br/>

###### \[Arceus’s force field fades away\]

Arceus: "Come on now Zeus. You know that I don’t want to do this any more than you want to."<br/>

###### \[Zeus turns away\]

Zeus: "..."<br/>

###### \[Zeus turns back to fire a lightning bolt, but Arceus is caught off guard so `<\PN>` is right in the way of it. Arceus pulls up the force field quickly after realizing what happens but `<\PN>` outside of it, and when the bolt strikes `<\PN>` it disintegrates leaving `<\PN>` unharmed\]

Zeus: "How&#151;"<br/>

###### \[Understanding dawns on Zeus’s face\]

Zeus: "Oh I see. You’re such a failure that you had to get a mortal to help you, didn’t you Arceus?"<br/>

###### \[Zeus laughs\]

Zeus: "<br/>This mortal is pathetic. 

###### \[Arceus narrows its eyes\]

Arceus: "`<\PN>`, I hope you remember my words from before. I will explain later. For now, we have to fight."<br/>

***(initiate Zeus battle, maybe a vs screen?)***

> title will probably need adjusting later if it’s too long

Fallen Olympian Leader Zeus has challenged you to a battle!

###### \[Post Battle\]

Professor Cypress: "Well, that was most certainly unexpected. They seemed to know your name `<\PN>`, do you know who they are?"<br/>

`<\PN>`: "Uh, I don't really know."<br/>

> Azfar defeats champion when you enter the room, gods break wall and you battle them, after you beat them in a multi battle with Azfar they retreat to Gaea and you follow them

> after you've beaten the 13 olympians they retreat to their mother, Gaea, and she attempts to kill but arceus blocks the shot and dies, the ring of arceus shatters and give the player an item and you battle gaea, post beating gaea, she opens up the earth and sends you to the deepest pit of hell, tartarus where you venture through and right before the gate to hell you encounter tartarus and battle him, At this point the team of scientist have finished making the seal to seal the gods and request you return at once

***(ENDING:
Soon after beating the gods and sealing them within the capsule specifically made by the team of professors, you head on to the place where time and space ends.
Having the power of the fallen Arceus you think how free you'd be, but how very wrong you were.
As Azfar succeeds in defeating the champion of Theos and Elina becomes a renowned professor, after showing her skills when the capsule was being built.
Seeing the world at peace makes you happy but not for long.
Your job forces you to stay in one place, eyes solely focused on the capsule in which the gods are sealed in, with the desolate space in the background.
No movement, no noise, there is absolutely nothing.
Every second feels like a water droplet falling onto your head but you are unable to change it, such is fate.
As you feel your sanity slipping away, you remember your journey and how it shaped the world.
People realizing such rich culture should not go to waste integrating it within art.
They sing epics about your battle against the gods, new philosophies were birthed.
You think how you had a lifetime of excitement in such a short time.
Making peace with your fate, you realize that your story has ended and that another one must begin, and you know exactly whose story it will be.)***
